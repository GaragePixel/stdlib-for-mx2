The license contains the following clause:

Because this work is an ongoing process that aims to test this library 
before its adaptation to wonkey, it is forbidden to perform this migration and publish it 
before the author gives permission.
This library works primarily for Monkey2, so I do not authorize that it be adapted for Monkey1 
(also called monkeyx) or any fork of monkey1 / monkeyx.
