	stdlib - Development log:

		PLANNEDs:

			- Planned: full std library, main features:
				- Fully dynamic library in the sense of dynamic programming
				- Many sugars and new function template that allows unordoned arguments
				- String function a-la Lua
				- Added a large number of mathematic features and primitives
				- Essential and solid implementations of popular algorithms
				- Should be 3x faster than the legacy std
				- New error handling sub-library
				- Multi-dialects (En, Jp, Fr... )
				- Please wait for the new agnostic graphic module in place of Mojo
